# M-Mount Lens Guide and Database

List of all M-mount lenses that can be acquired and used on all Leica M, Zeiss Ikon, Voightänder Bessa and some other quirky cameras from yesteryear. M-mount lenses are also favorite among digital mirrorless camera using adapters.

⚠️ This documents and database is work in progress.

Researching M-mount lenses is sometimes not easy for a couple of reasons:

1. There is a lot of old and not well-documented lenses that work perfectly well on any M-mount camera today.
2. M-mount is very popular and easy to adopt by many companies, these several vendors are making fully compatible lenses.
3. Even Leica is not great at having maintained a public database of all lenses they make.

There is a couple of requirements for the lens to make this list:
1. It has to work on both, digital and film, cameras.
2. It has to be bayonet M-mount lens.

## Leica Lens Nomenclature

Unlike Zeiss lenses, Leica lens names usually indicate their maximum aperture rather than design. Below is a rough explanation on what those strange words mean.

* Summicron — F/2.0 lenses.
* Summilux — F/1.4 lenses.
* Summarit — F/2.4 or F/2.5 lenses. These lenses are made for digital cameras in the mid-2000s. While they are optically excellent, some have noticeable barrel distortion which is easy to fix in a digital workflow.
* Noctilux — Anything faster than F/1.4. Most famous being F/0.95 50mm lens.
* Elmarit — F/2.8 lenses.
* Elmar / Super-Elmar — Between F/3.4 to F/4.0.
* Hector — F/4.5 and above.
* Thambar — Vintage design, soft-focusing lenses.

All above are trademarks of Leica Camera AG.

If you are looking into lenses made before 1960, those names above might make no sense since they were used differently. For example, Summarit lenses were F/1.5 instead of F/2.4–2.5; Summarex and Summaron names no longer exist.

Note that, on other mounts and camera systems those names are sometimes used more generously. Leica Q with 28mm F/1.7 Summilux (not F/1.4) comes to mind. 

Abbreviations and various marks on Leica lenses:

* ASPH. — The lens has at least one aspherical element.
* APO — The lens is chromatically corrected.
* Tri-... — The lens has three focal lengths, quasi-zoom lens.


## Zeiss Name Nomenclature

Zeiss lens names are [historical design names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photographic_lens_design).
